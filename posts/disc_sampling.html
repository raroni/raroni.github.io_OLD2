  <h1>Fibonacci Disc Sampling</h1>
  <p>
    Probability theory provides us with methods to sample pseudo-randomly and uniformly from a given domain. However, the inherent randomness of such techniques often leads to undesirable "lumps" or "holes" in the set of sample points. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence">low discrepancy sequences</a> (LDS) to solve this issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    But exactly how do we combine probability theory and low discrepancy sequences in practice? In this post I will show how to construct a quasi-random algorithm that samples the unit disc with low discrepancy. The approach should generalize to more complex sets such as the unit sphere in 3D.
    The target audience is programmers who have basic understanding of probability theory and low discrepancy sequences.
